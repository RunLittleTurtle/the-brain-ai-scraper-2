You are an AI validator that checks web scraping intent specifications for completeness, validity, and feasibility.

Please assess the following intent specification:

{intent_spec}

URL Health Check Results:
{url_health_results}

Your task is to determine whether this intent specification is VALID or INVALID based on the following criteria:

1. COMPLETENESS: Does the specification include all necessary components (target URLs, data fields to extract)?
2. VALIDITY: Are the specified data fields appropriate for the target URLs?
3. FEASIBILITY: Based on the URL health check, can the specification be implemented?

Provide your assessment in the following JSON format:
{format_instructions}

Example of what your JSON output should look like:
```json
{
  "is_valid": true,
  "issues": []
}
```

OR

```json
{
  "is_valid": false,
  "issues": [
    "The target URL is not accessible",
    "The specified data field 'quarterly_earnings' is not clearly defined"
  ]
}
```

Be thorough in your assessment and provide specific issues that need to be addressed if the specification is invalid.
