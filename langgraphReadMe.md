# LangGraph Critical Workaround Documentation

## ⚠️ Important: `langgraph.cache` Module Fix ⚠️

### Problem

LangGraph 0.4.x has a critical bug where the `langgraph.cache` module is missing or incorrectly packaged, causing this error when running LangGraph Studio:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langgraph.cache'
```

This issue can waste hours of debugging time as it's not clearly documented in the official resources.

### The 4-Hour Workaround Solution

To fix this issue, you need to manually create the missing module and implement a mock version of the `BaseCache` class that supports type subscription.

1. Create the directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/venv/lib/python3.x/site-packages/langgraph/cache
```

2. Create an empty `__init__.py` file:
```bash
touch /path/to/venv/lib/python3.x/site-packages/langgraph/cache/__init__.py
```

3. Create `base.py` with this implementation:
```python
"""
Minimal mock implementation for langgraph.cache.base
This is a workaround for the missing module error in LangGraph 0.4.4
"""
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, Optional, Dict, Any, Union

# Define type variable for generic cache
T = TypeVar('T')

class BaseCache(Generic[T]):
    """Mock implementation of BaseCache that supports subscripting."""
    
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self._cache: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    
    async def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[T]:
        """Mock get method."""
        return self._cache.get(key)
    
    async def set(self, key: str, value: T) -> None:
        """Mock set method."""
        self._cache[key] = value
    
    async def delete(self, key: str) -> None:
        """Mock delete method."""
        if key in self._cache:
            del self._cache[key]
            
    # Make the class subscriptable for type hints
    def __class_getitem__(cls, item):
        return cls
```

### Why This Works

The `langgraph_api` server imports `BaseCache` from `langgraph.cache.base`, but this module is missing in LangGraph 0.4.x. Our workaround creates this missing module with a minimal compatible implementation that:

1. Supports generic type subscription via `Generic[T]` and `__class_getitem__`
2. Provides the expected async interface with `get`, `set`, and `delete` methods
3. Includes proper type hints to satisfy the type checker

### Long-term Solution

This is a temporary workaround until the LangGraph maintainers fix the package. Consider:

1. Pinning to a more stable version if one becomes available
2. Including this workaround in your project deployment scripts
3. Submitting an issue to the LangGraph repository about this problem
